    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging): The random forest algorithm uses a technique called bagging, where multiple samples of the\n",

    "focusing too much on any one feature or set of features.\n",
